<h1>The Best Movies According to Abdul</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Home Alone</h3>
<p>
  This is a classic movie that I just love to watch because it gives me great
  vibes all the time.
</p>
<h3>Your Lie in April</h3>
<p>
  Technically not a movie, was meant to be, but the opening entices me and the
  tragic moments enhance everything that goes on even more. <br />
  <br />Especially with the knowledge of one soon to die building suspense.
</p>
<h3>D@bbe</h3>
<p>
  Horror series of movies, based off real experiences, very terrifying, a must
  watch but beware of nightmares.
